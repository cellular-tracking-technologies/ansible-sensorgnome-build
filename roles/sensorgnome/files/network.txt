# This file lets you set up a WiFi client connection for your SGPi.
# This connection will operate whenever the SGPi's own WiFi hotspot is
# off (see NOTES below).
#
# Please answer these 3 questions:
#
# 1. Do you want the SGPi to connect to a local WiFi router and
# automatically upload status and data to sensorgnome.org?  (Answer
# 'yes' or 'no' after the '=')

WifiClient = no

# 2. What is WiFi network name? (must be a WPA/WPA2-protected network)

NetworkName

# 3. What is the WiFI password? (do not use double quotation marks)

NetworkPassphrase

# NOTES
# =====
#
# Normally, the SGPi's WiFi adapter is off, but if you answered 'yes' to
# question 1 above, then the SGPi tries to maintain a connection to
# sensorgnome .org via the WiFi network you indicate.  This keeps the
# WiFi adapter on all the time, which will increase power consumption.
#
# SGPi WiFi HOTSPOT - activate
# ============================
#
# Regardless of whether you answer 'yes' or 'no' to question 1 above,
# you can turn on the SGPi's WiFi hotspot by double-clicking on the
# external button (the one with the LED ring).  While this hotspot is
# active, the SGPi will not be connected to any WiFi router.  An active
# hotspot is indicated by the external button LED blinking on and off
# at 0.9 second intervals.
#
# The hotspot will have the SGPi's serial number as both its network name
# and its network passphrase, e.g.:
#
#  Hotspot Name:     SG-26F1RPI358CC
#  Hotspot Password: SG-26F1RPI358CC
#
# When the hotspot is on, you can connect to the SGPi from your laptop
# or phone WiFi menu.  After connecting to the SGPi hotspot, you can
# access the SGPi's interface page in a web browser using one or both
# of these URLs:
#
#   http://sgpi.local     - most Macs, linux boxes, Windows computers with iTunes
#   http://192.168.7.2    - all computers, phones
#
# You can also use FileZilla (https://filezilla-project.org/) to download
# data from the SGPi's WiFi hotspot using these options:
#
#   hostname: sftp://192.168.7.2
#   username: root
#   password: root
#
# Your SG's files can then be found in the /media/internal_SD_card/SGdata folder
#
# SGPi WiFi HOTSPOT - deactivate
# ==============================
#
# The WiFi hotspot will turn OFF when any of these events occur:
#
# - you double-click the external button.  This will also turn off the
#   0.9 second LED blinking.
#
# - the WiFi hotspot times out.  This happens 30 minutes after the
#   hotspot is activated, regardless of network activity.  This also
#   turns off the 0.9 second LED blinking.
#
# - the SGPi reboots.  After rebooting, the hotspot is off until it is
#   activated by double-clicking the button.
